## About Me

Hello! I'm Jayesh Gajbhar, a passionate computer science graduate student at North Carolina State University with a strong focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have a solid background in software engineering and am always excited to explore the intersection of AI and software development to create innovative solutions.

My journey in the tech world is driven by curiosity and a desire to make a meaningful impact through my work. Whether it's building AI models from scratch, contributing to open-source projects, or developing robust software applications, I am always eager to tackle new challenges.

## What I'm Working On

- **AI-Powered Frontend Web Developer**: A project where I am creating an AI/ML model that continuously learns from public GitHub repositories and generates simple static websites. The goal is to ease the work of developers by automating repetitive tasks.
- **LLM-Forge**: A project focused on building a large language model (LLM) from scratch using a custom transformer architecture. This project is a personal challenge to create an LLM from the ground up in my own bedroom.
- **Exploring Efficient Fine-Tuning Techniques**: Experimenting with techniques like QLoRA and PEFT for fine-tuning LLMs and applying quantization methods for optimized model performance.

## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C++, Java
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, LLMs, Transformers
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js
- **Tools & Technologies**: Git, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Google Cloud
- **Other**: AR/VR Development (Unity, C#), Automation with Selenium

## Future Aspirations

I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities in software engineering and AI/ML roles, where I am inspired by the company's philosophy and innovative spirit. My goal is to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of technology and help make people's lives better through intelligent solutions.
